By using the CNN,machine leaning techniques , image processing, web and python(Flask Framework), we built an expert system
that helps doctors to diagnose pneumonia, determines the type of pneumonia, determines the patient’s
condition whether it is dangerous or not, and provides a suggested treatment. Also the system allows the
patient to see his results after his doctor’s approval.
